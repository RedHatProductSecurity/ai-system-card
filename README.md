# AI System Card Schema

This repository contains the **AI System Card Schema**, a machine-readable standard for documenting Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The schema is designed to promote transparency, security, and accountability in AI development by providing a structured format for sharing critical information.

***

## What is an AI System Card?

An **AI system card** is a document that provides a comprehensive overview of a complete AI system, not just the underlying model. It acts as a standardized "label" that helps developers and users understand the system's architecture, components, data sources, and most importantly, its security and safety posture.

Similar to how model cards provide details for a single AI model, system cards extend this concept to the entire AI ecosystem, including:
* **Architecture and components:** Details on how the system is built and what parts it uses.
* **Data pedigree:** Information about the data used for training and augmentation.
* **Security and safety:** A record of the system's security posture and a changelog of fixed issues.

***

## Why Use the AI System Card Schema?

The schema is built on an ethos of transparency, similar to open source software. By adopting a standard, open format, it enables:
* **Automated Policy Checks:** Tools can be built to automatically generate and consume system cards.
* **Informed Decision-Making:** Users can make objective, fact-based decisions about using or subscribing to an AI system.
* **Community Collaboration:** The open format encourages the community to inspect, audit, and contribute to the security of AI systems.

This schema is a collaborative effort to establish a common, interoperable, and machine-readable standard for documenting AI systems. We welcome contributions to help shape a more transparent and secure future for AI.

**Note on Usage:** The AI system card for "Ask Red Hat" found at [https://access.redhat.com/ai/system-card/ask-red-hat](https://access.redhat.com/ai/system-card/ask-red-hat) is a practical example generated by following this schema. This demonstrates how the schema can be applied to create transparent and auditable documentation for AI systems.

## Generate HTML system card from YAML

This repo includes a minimal toolchain to validate a YAML instance against the JSON Schema and render an HTML system card using a Jinja2 template.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+

### Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example data

An example instance is provided at `examples/ask-red-hat.yaml`.

### Validate and render

```bash
python system_card_generator.py \
  examples/ask-red-hat.yaml \
  schema/system-card.schema \
  --template templates/system_card.html.j2 \
  --output build/ask-red-hat.html
```

If validation succeeds, the rendered HTML will be written to `build/ask-red-hat.html`.

### Notes

- The HTML template (`templates/system_card.html.j2`) intentionally contains no CSS so it can be copied into other portals that apply their own styling.
- The tool uses `jsonschema` (Draft 2020-12) for validation and Jinja2 for rendering.
