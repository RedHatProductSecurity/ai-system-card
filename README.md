# AI System Card Schema

This repository contains the **AI System Card Schema**, a machine-readable standard for documenting Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The schema is designed to promote transparency, security, and accountability in AI development by providing a structured format for sharing critical information.

## What is an AI System Card?

An **AI system card** is a document that provides a comprehensive overview of a complete AI system, not just the underlying model. It acts as a standardized "label" that helps developers and users understand the system's architecture, components, data sources, and most importantly, its security and safety posture.

Similar to how model cards provide details for a single AI model, system cards extend this concept to the entire AI ecosystem, including:
* **Architecture and components:** Details on how the system is built and what parts it uses.
* **Data pedigree:** Information about the data used for training and augmentation.
* **Security and safety:** A record of the system's security posture and a changelog of fixed issues.

## Why Use the AI System Card Schema?

The schema is built on an ethos of transparency, similar to open source software. By adopting a standard, open format, it enables:
* **Automated Policy Checks:** Tools can be built to automatically generate and consume system cards.
* **Informed Decision-Making:** Users can make objective, fact-based decisions about using or subscribing to an AI system.
* **Community Collaboration:** The open format encourages the community to inspect, audit, and contribute to the security of AI systems.

This schema is a collaborative effort to establish a common, interoperable, and machine-readable standard for documenting AI systems. We welcome contributions to help shape a more transparent and secure future for AI.
