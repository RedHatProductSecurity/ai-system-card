security_and_safety:
  intent_and_use: >-
    Ask Red Hat is designed for users of Red Hatâ€™s products to search and
    retrieve publicly available Red Hat knowledge, product documentation,
    security data, support content, and other helpful information using natural
    language queries. It answers with information that is already public and
    customer-facing and is intended to support safe, professional use.
  scope: >-
    The system excludes responses that require disclosure of internal-only or
    confidential information. It does not support modification of system-level
    instructions through prompt injection and will reject or neutralize such
    attempts. While it can discuss security topics (e.g., XSS) at a general and
    educational level, it does not provide step-by-step exploit instructions.
  security_considerations: >-
    Safeguards such as Granite Guardian, rate limiting, and input sanitation are
    in place to reduce abuse. As with similar systems, inherent risks remain,
    and the system is designed to answer security-related questions in a safe
    and preventative manner.
